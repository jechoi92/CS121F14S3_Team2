Division Tip

When dividing, flip the second fraction, and then you can just multiply. 

If the numerator of the second fraction shares factors with the numerator of 
the first, you can perform a quick simplifcation before flipping just by
dividing each horizontally. 

If it doesn't look easy at first, just flip the second fraction and multiply 
the fractions!
